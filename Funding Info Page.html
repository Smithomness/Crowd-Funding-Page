        <p class="info">Hi my name is Smith Joseph creator of She's Gothic. Currently this is a complete self made Fashion brand for Gothic Attire. But She's Gothic is
            more than just a store page but also play a part in the community by offering opportunities for models, fashion designers, photographers, editors, and all forms of content
            creators as well as a way to shed more light on industries where females lack representation such as streaming, gaming, sports like skating, etc. We want to empower people to follow their passions and also teach them how to make a living while doing so. Along side our store will be a completely free business course using my very own brand as a model 
            for others to follow. There will be no paywall I just want to share and help people find the skills and information they need to to work on proejects, find freelancers, or show off and provide your own skills and work 
            tp people who may want to work with or for you. People will be drawn to She's Gothic for the store and brand appeal but our community is why they will stay.

        <h id="donate" class="subheaders">Why Donate?</h>
        <p class="info">Up until now I've been doing everything on my own. From designig the products, webpages, margins, getting LLC's in order. 
        Every part of this business so far has been created and designed by me and me alone. But there's only so much I can do by myself. 
        The main website for She's Gothic that I am working on still requires a lot of work like setting up API's, Connecting a database for orders and user information,
        setting up payment processing and tracking for orders and honestly much more backend functionality that is needed for a complete user experience. 
        For this I am funding because turns out it's quite the price.<br>
        Also you will be investing in someone with plan. No part of this hasn't been thought and planned for. I have a 30+ business plan/portfolio that I plan on sharing with investors as well.
        I currently won't be posting it publicly to protect my ideaas and concepts but they will later be displayed in my business course when it goes live. It details everything from margins, 
        products, shipping, advertising & Markering plan, spedning plan, target audience, hiring plan, brand partnerships and collaaborations, and many other aspects of why
        </p>

    <div>
        <h id="spend" class="subheaders">Spending Plan</h>
        <p class="info">The spending will mostly be directed torwards building the backend or functionality for my website. Such as API's, javascript for cart and shopping funcitons,
        setting up a database to maintain and store customer information securely. Setting up payment processing and tracking for customers. Essentially setting up the 
        functionality of the website will likely be where %70 - %80 of funding will go to. The rest will be put towards our first marketing campaign. Getting pictures, videos,
        hiring models to wear our products, posting and running ads on social media sites and basically anything that comes along with promoting and marketing our brand.
        So far I've been a one man show. I've been learing everything this far when it comes to building this website and I will continue to do so. The problem is time.
        How much time would it take for me to learn sending https request, setting up API's, serverside code languages like nodejs or php, using javascript for shopping cart functions, setting up Stripe so customers can 
        make secure payments. There is just so much that come's along with building a website. Most people see and interact with the front-end of the website but the back-end is what makes those interactions
        seemless.

    <div>
     <h id="updates" class="subheaders">Get Updates</h>
     <p class="info"> I want to offer as much transparency as possible with funds that are recieved and the rate of progress of our main site in a monthly rate. I will either be posting our progress here on this
        site or you can sign up and recieve monthly updates through email. In this way poeple can trust that their hard earned money won't be misappropiacted. Even though this business isn't in full operation 
        I would still like to treat like so and be as professional and transparent as possible. I would rather building a small customer base built through trust rather than a large customer base built off bad practice and lies. 
       Corporrate greed has sadly become a common business practice and I plan to use She's Gothic to show there's another business model. You can still have a successful business or service without taking advantage of your custumer base.
        So if you'd like to keep up with us please sign up and receive monthly updates!
